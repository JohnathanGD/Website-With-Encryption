The goal of this project is to take the project that we developed in Assignment #5 and make
the website have more functionallity and to make the website more secure for each user. In this
increment of the website we were tasked with adding a log in page, 3 different homes for each
level of security, each individuals contest result pages, contest entry page, and using encryption
and decryption in order to secure each users name, password and phone number. 
I used code generated by an AI tool.
